# portTrack

Global multi-asset portfolio tracking and Indian tax compliance for Indian tax residents —
local-first, privacy-first, containerized.

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`Global_Portfolio_Tracker_PRD.md`](./Global_Portfolio_Tracker_PRD.md) | Product requirements (source of truth) |
| [`implementation_plan_portrack.md`](./implementation_plan_portrack.md) | ADRs, 80 user stories, acceptance criteria, DoD, milestone tracker |
| [`ARCHITECTURE_portrack.md`](./ARCHITECTURE_portrack.md) | C4 component views + 7 data-flow sequence diagrams |

## Current status — all milestones complete

> They predate the current work and are listed rather than hidden.

**Every one of the eleven packages is green**, and the containerised stack runs: `docker compose up`
on a host with only Docker brings up the API and SPA, with your encrypted database on your own disk.

M0–M10 are done: kernel, asset ledger, FX and dual-rate conversion, snapshots, tax engine, ingestion,
PII masking, API/UI/CLI, containers, and the Schedule FA/AL exports.

> ⚠ **Tax rates are PROVISIONAL.** Computation works; `assertFilingReady` refuses to emit any filing
> artifact until the rates are sourced from the Finance Act and marked `VERIFIED`. The dashboard
> shows a provisional banner wherever a tax figure appears. **This is the one thing standing between
> the product and real use.**

> ⚠ **Name masking over-masks by design**, and the egress guard cannot catch a name the detector
> never recognised — see `packages/pii-masker/src/verifier.ts`.

> ⚠ **Schedule FA Table A3 is unavailable, by choice.** It requires the peak value over the calendar
> year, which needs a daily price and exchange-rate series this build does not record. It returns an
> explicit error rather than rows computed from the closing value, which would understate the peak —
> the dangerous direction under the Black Money Act. Table D and Schedule AL work.

## Running it

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # set PORTTRACK_DATA_DIR and your UID/GID
docker compose up
```

Then open <http://localhost:5173>. Nothing else is required — no Node, no pnpm, no toolchain.

### Manual entry — CSV templates

Not everything has a broker export. For hand loans, property, cash, chit funds and unlisted shares,
download a template from **Import → Manual entry**, fill it in a spreadsheet, and import it with
*portTrack CSV template* selected.

| Template | Records | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| `Custom_HandLoans` | Loans, with repayment and interest history | `borrower_name`, `notes`, `loan_date`, `closed_date`, `loan_amount`, `interest_rate_pct`, `status`, two `principal_repayment_n`/`principal_date_n` pairs, four `interest_payment_n`/`date_n` pairs |
| `Custom_RealEstate` | Land and buildings, at cost | `property_name`, `purchase_date`, `purchase_price`, `stamp_duty`, `registration_fee` |
| `Custom_Cash` | Cash and bank balances | `account_label`, `as_of_date`, `balance` |
| `Custom_ChitFunds` | Chit funds and savings schemes | `scheme_name`, `start_date`, `monthly_instalment`, `total_months` |
| `Custom_UnlistedShares` | Private company shares | `company_name`, `acquisition_date`, `quantity`, `price_per_share` |
| `Custom_GenericBroker` | Any broker without a parser | `trade_date`, `symbol`, `isin`, `trade_type`, `quantity`, `price` |

The same files are committed at [`templates/`](./templates), generated from the parser's own column
definitions by `npx tsx scripts/emit-templates.mts` — so the header you fill in and the header the
importer matches against can never drift apart.

Choosing **portTrack CSV template** as the statement type reveals a second dropdown listing the six
templates. Leave it on *Detect from the file's header* and the header decides, as before. Naming one
buys a better failure: a mismatch then reports the exact columns at fault —

```
Custom_Cash template header mismatch — missing column(s): balance
```

— rather than `this header matches no portTrack template: …`. It also catches a Hand Loans file
uploaded under Cash, which would otherwise import cleanly as the wrong asset class, and therefore
under the wrong tax treatment.

The hand-loan template also accepts the five **derived** columns a tracking sheet keeps —
`status`, `total_interest_months`, `interest_balance_months`, `interest_per_month`,
`total_overall_interest`, `interest_balance` — so an existing spreadsheet pastes in unchanged. They
are **recomputed**, not trusted: where a stated figure disagrees with the computed one the import
reports it rather than silently overriding either. A sheet that says only *"Repaid"*, with no
repayment row, has the repayment reconstructed on its closing date — otherwise the loan would show
its full principal outstanding, contradicting its own status.

**The template is identified by its header row**, which is why the header must stay exactly as
downloaded. Each template declares the asset class it holds; nothing is inferred from the file, since
asset class drives tax treatment and a wrong guess would be invisible. The `#` guidance lines at the
top are ignored on import — fill the file in and upload it as-is.

> `borrower_name` is hashed to an opaque reference that identifies the loan; the name itself is kept
> in your encrypted vault so the register can be filtered and sorted by it. It never appears in an
> AI payload or a log line. A **loan export you ask for does carry it** — that is what makes the file
> readable to the accountant or borrower you hand it to.

### Unlocking takes a moment, on purpose

The first unlock **sets** the passphrase; there is no default and no recovery path. Deriving the key
runs Argon2id at the OWASP baseline, which occupies a core for a few hundred milliseconds — that cost
is the point, since it is what makes guessing expensive.

The button therefore disables itself and says so while it works. Derivation runs on a worker thread,
so the rest of the API stays responsive: a health probe issued mid-unlock returns in 0.8 ms, against
310 ms when the KDF ran on the main thread and froze everything.

> A browser tab left open on the unlock screen will re-submit as soon as the API comes back. If you
> are deliberately wiping `data/`, close or reload that tab first, or it will recreate the vault
> under its old passphrase before you get there.

### Loans — the hand-loan register

A dedicated **Loans** tab replaces a hand-loan tracking spreadsheet. Record a loan, take interest
against it, take part of the principal back, and see what is still owed.

| It tracks | Because |
|---|---|
| Several loans to one borrower | Same day, different days, different years — each keeps its own rate and dates |
| Interest payments, unlimited | A spreadsheet had four columns and lost the fifth |
| Partial principal repayments | Interest accrues on the **declining balance** from the repayment date |
| Payment mode and notes | What a disputed payment turns on |
| Status: active / partially repaid / repaid | Derived from the principal, never typed in |

**Two tiles for pending interest, not one.** Interest owed on a loan whose principal has already
come back has no repayment arriving alongside it, so it is the balance most easily forgotten. Folded
into a single figure it disappears inside the larger number for live loans.

**The tiles describe the filtered set.** Filter to one borrower and the totals become that
borrower's. Filter by any combination of status and borrower; sort by borrower, status, loan date or
amount; export what you are looking at as **CSV or PDF**.

Everything is computed by the API, never in the browser — summing decimal strings in JavaScript
would reintroduce the float drift ADR-002 exists to prevent, and these are amounts someone owes you.

**A live loan counts toward net worth** as outstanding principal plus the interest **still owed**.
Interest already received is deliberately excluded: that money is sitting in a bank account, and
counting it again as a receivable would report it twice.

Loans appear in the **Ledger** under *Loans receivable*, not under Holdings. A loan is a receivable,
not a holding of units — it has no lots, no quantity and no cost per unit — so it is carried at
principal outstanding plus interest owed, and those carrying values sum to exactly the hand-loan
figure in net worth.

Amounts can be typed the way you write them — `1,00,000`, `100,000`, `₹1,00,000` all read as one
lakh. A comma is always a digit separator, never a decimal point.

> Borrower **names** live in the encrypted vault because the register is filtered and sorted by them.
> Anything that leaves this machine carries the opaque `borrowerRef` instead — except an export you
> ask for by name, which necessarily carries the name, since that is what makes it readable.

### Where your data lives

`${PORTTRACK_DATA_DIR:-./data}/vault.db` **on your own disk**, bind-mounted into the container
(ADR-012). Deliberately not a Docker named volume: those live under `/var/lib/docker`, are owned by
root, are invisible to your backup tooling and vanish to `docker volume prune`.

```
data/
├── vault.db            encrypted database (AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA512, page level)
├── vault.db.meta.json  KDF salt and parameters — BACK THIS UP TOO
└── vault.db-wal/-shm   SQLite write-ahead log
```

> **Back up the whole directory, not just `vault.db`.** The salt lives in `vault.db.meta.json`. A
> backup of the database alone restores to a vault nobody can open — and you would only discover
> that when you needed it most. `pnpm` users get this right automatically via `Backup.backup`, which
> archives both.

Your data survives `docker compose down`, `docker compose build --no-cache`, container recreation and
Docker Engine upgrades. Verified by the container suite, not assumed.

### Operator reference

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| First run | `cp .env.example .env && docker compose up` |
| Match file ownership to you | set `PORTTRACK_UID=$(id -u)` and `PORTTRACK_GID=$(id -g)` in `.env` |
| Change where data lives | set `PORTTRACK_DATA_DIR=/path/on/your/disk` |
| Back up | copy the whole data directory while the stack is stopped |
| Restore | copy it back, then `docker compose up` |
| Upgrade | `git pull && docker compose up --build` — data is untouched |
| Logs | `docker compose logs -f api` |
| Allow outbound (FX/NAV) | `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.egress.yaml up` |

The API publishes **no** host port and sits on an isolated network with no route to the internet.
That is not the application policing itself — the network has no gateway, so a compromised dependency
inside the API cannot exfiltrate a vault even if it tries.

### Developing without containers

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @porttrack/app-web dev   # SPA on :5173, proxying /api
node apps/api/build.mjs && node apps/api/dist/server.mjs
```

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test              # unit + functional (hermetic, no network)
pnpm typecheck         # strict TS, currently clean
pnpm bench             # NFR-2 performance budgets
pnpm test:container    # FR-8 Docker acceptance — needs a Docker daemon
pnpm test:e2e          # Playwright against the containerized stack
```

`test:e2e` needs the stack running and a matching browser:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium         # once; downloads ~115 MB
docker compose up -d
PORTTRACK_WEB_PORT=5273 pnpm test:e2e   # match the port in your .env
```

It asserts what each section **renders**, not that its link exists — the distinction that let a
completely dead navigation bar pass as DONE once already.

## Running the stack (from M9)

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # set PORTTRACK_DATA_DIR, PORTTRACK_UID/GID
docker compose up
```

Your encrypted database lives on **your own disk** at `${PORTTRACK_DATA_DIR:-./data}/vault.db` via a
bind mount — not in a Docker-managed volume. It survives `docker compose down`, image rebuilds and
Docker upgrades, and you can back it up with ordinary host tools (ADR-012).

## Design commitments

- **Dual FX rate per foreign transaction** (ADR-003) — trade-date ITBR for valuation, Rule 115 rate
  for taxable income. Resolves the PRD's FR-1 vs FR-2 conflict; both are stored with provenance.
- **All money is `Decimal`** (ADR-002). No `number` arithmetic on currency, anywhere.
- **Tax rates are FY-keyed data** (ADR-005), never literals in engine code.
- **Snapshots are immutable and content-addressed** (ADR-006).
- **PII masking runs in the browser and fails closed** (ADR-007, ADR-013). Two independent guards;
  neither warns-and-continues.
- **Zero network egress by default** (ADR-010), through a single audited gateway.
- **Periods are server-derived** (`GET /api/reference/periods`). The browser never decides which
  financial year it is — a client a timezone away would disagree with the engine computing the tax.
  The current FY and calendar year are always *offered*; the *default* is the most recent period that
  can actually be computed, which is not the same thing.

## Repository layout

```
packages/   shared-kernel · core-domain · fx-itbr · tax-engine · snapshot
            ingestion · compliance · pii-masker · persistence · adapters-fx · app-services
apps/       api (Fastify) · web (React SPA) · cli
docker/     api.Dockerfile · web.Dockerfile · Caddyfile · entrypoint
tests/      functional · container · e2e · fixtures · test-kit
```

Domain packages are pure — no `fs`, no `fetch`, no ambient clock. Time and identity are injected
ports, which is what makes the tax engine deterministically testable across financial years.

## Test fixtures

All fixtures are synthetic. No real PAN, Aadhaar, folio or account number is in this repository; a
guard test enforces it. The encrypted CAMS CAS fixture is generated by
[`tests/fixtures/cams/generate-cas-fixture.mjs`](./tests/fixtures/cams/generate-cas-fixture.mjs),
a zero-dependency implementation of the PDF standard security handler.
