/**
 * Hash routing (US-8.5).

 * Hash rather than history API, and no router dependency. The SPA is served by
 * Caddy with a `try_files` fallback, so both would work — but a hash keeps the
 * routed state entirely inside the document, which means a deep link cannot
 * depend on server configuration staying correct. One less thing that can break
 * an offline, self-hosted install.
