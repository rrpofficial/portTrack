/**
 * Peak value over a period (US-6.1, PRD FR-6.1).
 *
 * Schedule FA asks for the HIGHEST value a foreign holding reached during the
 * calendar year, not its closing value. The two differ sharply for anything
 * volatile, and reporting the closing figure understates the disclosure — which
 * is the failure the Black Money Act penalises.
 *
 * The peak is computed per day from the quantity actually held on that day, so a
 * mid-year sale cannot leave the earlier, larger holding valued at the later
 * quantity.
