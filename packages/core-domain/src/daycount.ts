/**
 * Day-count basis for interest accrual.
 *
 * portTrack uses **30/360** throughout. This is not an arbitrary pick — it is the
 * only convention that satisfies both acceptance criteria simultaneously:
 *
 *   PRD FR-1: ₹5,000,000 at 8% from 2025-04-01, valued 2026-03-31 → ₹400,000.
 *     That requires a year fraction of exactly 1.0. ACT/365 gives 364/365 and
 *     yields ₹398,904.11, contradicting the PRD.
 *
 *   US-1.11: accrued interest on the start date itself is zero.
 *     That rules out inclusive-endpoint ACT counting, which would give 365/365 for
 *     the case above but 1 day (not 0) on the start date.
 *
 * 30/360 gives 360/360 = 1.0 for a full financial year and 0 on the start date.
 * Indian private lending has no statutory basis, so the PRD's own figure governs.
