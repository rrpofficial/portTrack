/**
 * The hand-loan audit trail (US-1.11).
 *
 * A loan is a claim on another person's money, and the terms of that claim are
 * exactly what gets disputed years later. Once a loan can be edited at all, the
 * value shown on screen stops being evidence of anything on its own: it is only
 * the latest value. What makes it evidence again is the trail of how it got
 * there.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **Append-only.** A correction is a further entry, never a rewrite of an
 *     earlier one. There is no update or delete for the audit table anywhere in
 *     the codebase, which is what makes the trail worth reading.
 *  2. **Field-level.** One entry per field actually changed, carrying both the
 *     old and the new value. An entry saying only "loan edited" cannot answer
 *     whether the principal moved, which is the question that matters.
 *  3. **Unchanged fields produce nothing.** Submitting the edit form without
 *     touching anything must leave no trace, or the trail fills with noise and
 *     stops being read — which is the same as not having one.
