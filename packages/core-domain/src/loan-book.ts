/**
 * The hand-loan register (US-1.11, hand-loan tracking requirements).
 *
 * Replaces a spreadsheet whose columns were: borrower, notes, loan date, closed
 * date, amount, status, rate, total interest months, interest balance months,
 * interest per month, total interest, interest balance, and four fixed pairs of
 * interest payment + date. Every one of those is derived here except the facts
 * the lender records — and the four payment columns become an unbounded list,
 * because a loan running four years at quarterly interest needs sixteen.
 *
 * Three distinctions carry the whole module, and each is a way real money goes
 * missing in a spreadsheet:
 *
 *  1. **Interest payments are not principal repayments.** Paying interest does
 *     not reduce what is owed. Conflating them writes off principal silently.
 *  2. **A loan whose principal is fully repaid can still owe interest.** Status
 *     therefore tracks the PRINCIPAL, and pending interest is reported for
 *     settled loans separately from live ones — they are collected differently
 *     and one is far easier to forget.
 *  3. **Interest accrues on the declining balance.** From the date of a partial
 *     repayment, only the remaining principal earns. Charging the original sum
 *     throughout overstates what is owed and is the error a borrower notices.
