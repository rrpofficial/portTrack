/**
 * Projecting parsed statement rows onto the asset ledger (US-4.1).
 *
 * The parsers deliberately stop at "these are the rows". This is where rows
 * become holdings: a BUY opens a lot, a SELL consumes lots FIFO, a dividend
 * becomes an income event. It lives in `ingestion` rather than `app-services`
 * because it is a rule, not wiring, and rules belong in a domain package.
 *
 * Two properties matter more than completeness here:
 *
 *  1. **Identity is derived, not generated.** Asset and lot ids come from the
 *     statement content, so re-importing the same file merges into the same
 *     holdings instead of duplicating them (US-4.7).
 *  2. **Nothing is silently absorbed.** A row this cannot place — an account-level
 *     fee with no lot to attach to, a generic template row with no asset class —
 *     comes back in `unapplied` with a reason. Quietly folding an unattributable
 *     fee into some arbitrary lot would invent a cost basis, and an invented cost
 *     basis is indistinguishable from a real one once it is stored.
