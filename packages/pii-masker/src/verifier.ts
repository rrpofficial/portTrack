 * "mostly" works is indistinguishable from one that does not.
 *
 * ⚠ **Known limit, stated rather than glossed:** this catches anything with a
 * SHAPE — PAN, Aadhaar, demat IDs, contacts, transaction IDs — and it re-runs the
 * name detector to catch a pipeline that forgot to mask. It CANNOT catch a name
 * the detector never recognised, because names have no shape. The plan's original
 * risk mitigation (R5) claimed this guard was the backstop for NER false
 * negatives; that claim was wrong and is corrected in the plan.
