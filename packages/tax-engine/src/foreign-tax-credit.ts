 * Foreign tax credit / DTAA relief (US-5.11).

 * Relief is the LOWER of foreign tax actually paid and the Indian tax on the same

 * country's excess out of the Indian exchequer; the excess is therefore reported
 * as non-creditable rather than silently dropped, because the taxpayer may be
 * able to reclaim it in the source country.
