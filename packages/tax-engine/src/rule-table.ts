/**
 * Versioned tax rule table (US-5.2, ADR-005).
 *
 * No rate literal appears anywhere in engine code. Slabs, surcharge bands, cess,
 * capital gains rates and every threshold are data keyed by financial year,
 * because they move with each Finance Act and a hardcoded 12.5% becomes a defect
 * the day the Act passes.
 *
 * A missing year is an ERROR, never a fallback to the nearest available set:
 * computing FY 2030-31 with FY 2025-26 rates would produce a confident wrong
 * number, which is worse than refusing.
 *
 * PROVISIONAL RULE SETS: a rule set may declare `status: "PROVISIONAL"`, meaning
 * its structure is right but its numbers are unverified placeholders. Such a set
 * is usable for computation and testing, but {@link assertFilingReady} refuses it,
 * so no filing artifact can be produced from unverified rates.
