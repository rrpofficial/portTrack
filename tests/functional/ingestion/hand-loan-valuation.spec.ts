/**
 * FUNCTIONAL — two loans to the same borrower must both count.
 *
 * Reported from the running app: a template importing ₹26,00,000 and ₹4,00,000
 * of hand loans showed ₹30,00,000 on the Ledger but only ₹4,00,000 on the
 * Dashboard, and a net worth of ₹5,00,000 instead of ₹31,00,000.
 *
 * Two faults, one visible number:
 *
 *  1. Hand loans were keyed on the BORROWER, so both rows collapsed into one
 *     asset holding two lots but only the first row's loan terms.
 *  2. `ValuationEngine` valued a hand loan from that single `handLoan` block —
 *     "a loan receivable has no lots" — so the second lot was never read.
 *
 * The dangerous part is that nothing looked broken: the total was wrong but
 * plausible, and the Ledger, which sums lots, disagreed with the Dashboard,
 * which did not.
