/**
 * FUNCTIONAL — a typed amount must never be able to break the register.
 *
 * Reported from the running app: the Loans tab sat at "Loading…" forever. The
 * API was returning 500 with `[DecimalError] Invalid argument: 1,00,000` — an
 * interest payment had been entered as `1,00,000`, which is a completely
 * reasonable thing to type, and the recorders validated nothing. The string
 * reached the vault, and every subsequent read of ANY loan threw on it.
 *
 * That is the shape worth pinning: not "bad input is rejected" but "bad input
 * cannot poison later reads", because the failure was total and left no way to
 * find the offending row from inside the application.
