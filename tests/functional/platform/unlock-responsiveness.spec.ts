/**
 * FUNCTIONAL — unlocking must not freeze the rest of the application.
 *
 * The regression this pins, measured against the container before the fix:
 *
 *   ten unlock requests   0.35s → 0.70s → 1.05s → … → 3.50s   perfectly serialized
 *   health probe mid-unlock  0.310s   versus   0.001s idle
 *
 * Argon2id at the OWASP baseline occupies a core for roughly a third of a second
 * by design. Run on the main thread it blocked Node's event loop for that whole
 * time, so nothing else could be served and concurrent unlocks queued instead of
 * overlapping. Combined with an unlock button that showed no progress, the
 * natural response — clicking again — added another 350 ms of freeze per click,
 * and the app appeared to hang.
 *
 * These tests assert the PROPERTY (the loop keeps turning, work overlaps), never
 * a wall-clock budget, so they do not become flaky on a loaded CI machine.
